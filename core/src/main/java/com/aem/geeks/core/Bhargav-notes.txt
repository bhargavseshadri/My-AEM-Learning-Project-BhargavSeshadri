2) FETCHING DATA FROM EXTERNAL API (using sling model)
- Main:
STEP:1(just Interface) : com/aem/geeks/core/models/ExternalAPIDemoModel.java
STEP:2(sling model implimentation) : FETCHING DATA: com/aem/geeks/core/models/impl/ExternalAPIDemoModel.java
STEP:3 : RENDERING THE DATA ON FRONTEND: apps/aemgeeks/components/helloworld/helloworld.html

=============================================================================================
3) HTL
a)data-sly-list:  LOOPING
-> apps/aemgeeks/components/content/author-books/author-books.html
-> Its model is in : com/aem/geeks/core/models/impl/AuthorBooksImpl.java

b)data-sly-repeat: everything is exactly similar to data-sly-list but only difference is in page html structure list-have only one parent container and inside it it have <p> tags,
but Repeat creates div containers for every iteration

--------------------
-> We use the below three combined
c)data-sly-template(STEP: 1): for creating template (to reuse the code) :FILE: apps/aemgeeks/components/structure/home/head.html
d)data-sly-use (STEP: 2): here we use this to get that file where the template is defined. :File: apps/aemgeeks/components/structure/home/home.html
e)data-sly-call(STEP: 3) : use to call the specific template written in that file  :File: apps/aemgeeks/components/structure/home/home.html

--------------------
f)data-sly-attribute : used to give attributes like class,id in html structure

--------------------
g)data-sly-include : used to include files, if we want to include any file like html,jsp we use this.
-> Example and notes for this is at : apps/aemgeeks/components/content/author-books/author-books.html
-> Note: the path you include is not a valid one, then in that case it won't render anything.

--------------------
h)data-sly-resource : used to include resources
