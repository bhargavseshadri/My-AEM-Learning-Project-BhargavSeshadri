***Complete Junit Related Notes***

Important Points:
> Whenever we are testing something like testing some method in one class, Then we have to create an instance of that class. For static methods its not required.

======================================================================================================
Junit Notes:

a) Test Lifecycle: four types, Used to manage shared resources, initialization, and cleanup.
1. Before all tests
2. Before each test
3. After each test
4. After all tests

------------------------------------------------------------------
b) Core Annotations

1. @Test
> To tell the junit that this is a test method, so Execute it. if we put this annotation then the Junit know that this method needs to run.
> It is used to mark a method as a test case so the JUnit Platform can discover it and execute it.
> The central annotation for writing tests.

2. @BeforeEach
> Runs before every test method.
> Used for per-test initialization.
> for creating fresh objects.

3. @AfterEach
> Runs after every test method.
> Used for cleanup.
> Close resources, reset external state.

4. @BeforeAll
> Runs once before all tests in the class.
> Must be static by default.
> Typical use: Expensive setup (database, server, shared resources).

5. @AfterAll
> Runs once after all tests in the class.
> Must be static by default.
> Typical use: Global cleanup.

6. @Disabled
> Disables a test or test class.

7. @ParameterizedTest
> 

------------------------------------------------------------------
c) Assertions (Verification API) (Assertions validate expected outcomes.)

Main Assertions Methods

1. assertEquals : Verifies expected value equals actual value.
2. assertNotEquals : Verifies values are different.
3. assertTrue: Verifies a condition is true.
4. assertFalse: Verifies a condition is false.
5. assertNull: Verifies an object is null.
6. assertNotNull: Verifies an object is not null.
7. assertSame: Verifies two references point to the same object.
8. assertNotSame: Verifies two references do not point to the same object.
9. assertArrayEquals: Verifies array contents are equal.

> Exception Assertions
1. assertThrows: Verifies that a specific exception is thrown.
2. assertDoesNotThrow: Verifies that no exception is thrown

> Grouped Assertions
1. assertAll: Executes multiple assertions and reports all failures together.
